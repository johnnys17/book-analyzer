The Book Price Analyzer is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that processes a book's title and price to calculate and display facts like discounts and cost per page. Created as part of my Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course, it showcases fundamental JavaScript skills for my journey to become a full-stack developer.
